# HR Workforce Dynamics Dashboard



* A powerful, interactive HR analytics platform combining a robust PL/SQL backend for data extraction with a modern Streamlit frontend for visualization. This project transforms raw HR data into actionable insights through dynamic charts, an animated GIF-enhanced UI, and a sleek light blue/navy theme.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **HR Workforce Dynamics Dashboard** empowers HR teams to analyze employee metrics with ease. The backend, built with PL/SQL, processes complex HR data from an Oracle database, generating CSV reports for salary distribution, tenure, turnover, and more. The frontend, developed with Streamlit, visualizes these reports through interactive Plotly charts, including donut charts, histograms, and scatter plots, all styled in a cohesive light blue/navy theme.

Key features include:
- **PL/SQL Backend**: A comprehensive package (`my_hr_project.sql`) with procedures for generating 10+ HR reports, handling data cleaning, and exporting to CSV.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: A responsive UI with 9 visualization pages, a custom GIF header, and a 6-card Home page summarizing key metrics (e.g., total employees, top region).
- **Data Insights**: Visualizes salary ranges (Low: < $3,000, Mid: $3,000–$7,000, High: > $7,000), tenure distribution, turnover rates, and geographic employee distribution.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Processing**:
  - PL/SQL package with utility functions (`get_dept_name`, `calculate_tenure`) and procedures for generating reports like `salary_distribution` and `location_employee_report`.
  - Handles PL/SQL-exported CSVs with robust error handling using `UTL_FILE` and `DBMS_SQL`.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
 
  - Bar, line, histogram, and scatter plots for metrics like hiring trends, turnover,salary distribution  and salary growth.
  - Custom light blue/navy theme for a professional, artistic look.

- **User Experience**:
  - Animated GIF on the Home page to visually represent the workforce.
  - Sidebar navigation for seamless access to 9 visualization pages.
  - Responsive card layout summarizing key metrics (e.g., top department, highest salary).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PL/SQL (Oracle SQL), UTL_FILE, DBMS_SQL
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, Plotly
- **Styling**: HTML, CSS (custom dashboard styling)
- **Data**: CSV files generated from HR database tables

## 🖥️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Oracle Database (for PL/SQL execution)
- Python 3.9+
- Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, PyArrow (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aya-Ai-2022/hr_app.git
   cd hr-workforce-dashboard
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the PL/SQL script in Oracle SQL Developer:
   ```sql
   @my_hr_project.sql
   BEGIN
       hr_analysis_pkg.generate_all_reports;
   END;
   ```
4. Place generated CSVs in `C:/HR_DIR/` (or update `HR_DIR` in `app.py`).
5. OR run the Streamlit dashboard using HR_DIR with exported csvs:
   ```bash
   streamlit run fil.py
   ```

### Deployment
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Deploy the dashboard for online access (requires CSVs in repo or a file server).

## 🔧 Challenges Overcome

- **PL/SQL**: Managed complex data joins and aggregations (e.g., `NTILE` for salary quartiles, `RANK` for top salaries).
- **Streamlit**: Resolved `pyarrow` dependency issues through environment reconfiguration, ensuring robust DataFrame handling.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled PL/SQL-exported CSVs with inconsistent formats using Pandas.

## 📬 Future Improvements

- Add real-time database integration to Streamlit using `oracledb`.
- Implement user authentication for secure dashboard access.
- Enhance visualizations with advanced Plotly animations.
